# Task 1: Understanding Cyber Security Basics & Attack Surface

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship. The goal of this task was to establish a foundational understanding of the CIA triad, identify different types of attackers, and map out attack surfaces for common applications.

## 📁 Deliverables
- **Research Document:** A PDF explaining the CIA triad, attacker profiles, and attack surfaces.
- **Data Flow Analysis:** Documentation showing how data moves from User → Application → Server → Database and identifying potential attack points.
- **OWASP Top 10 Summary:** Analysis of critical web vulnerabilities.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- **CIA Triad:** Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
- **Attacker Profiles:** Script Kiddies, Insiders, Hacktivists, and Nation-State actors.
- **Attack Surfaces:** Web apps, APIs, Networks, and Cloud infrastructure.
- **Risk Assessment:** Understanding the difference between Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
